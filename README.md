# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

I wrote this Study Guide to help bootcamp students to collate their notes and information they have learned on during the course in a logical and cohesive manner to make revision easier. I have learned how different coding languages can work together to create an end user experience that is engaging and adds value.
